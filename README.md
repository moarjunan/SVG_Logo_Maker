# SVG Logo Gener

A simple logo creator 

Bootcamp Challenge 09: NodeJS

Description

This application was created to empower freelance web developers in designing uncomplicated logos for their clients and projects, eliminating the need for hiring a graphic designer. It employs the inquirer library to guide users through the command line, seeking input on various aspects of the logo, such as the desired text (limited to 3 characters), text color, logo shape (triangle, square, or circle), and the color of the chosen shape. Once the user completes these prompts, the application generates an SVG file based on their selections, producing a customized logo.
